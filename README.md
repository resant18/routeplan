| File | Description |

| [components](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/frontend/src/components) | Container and presentational components |
| [actions](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/frontend/src/actions) | These actions can be dispatched to trigger a Redux state change. They return POJOs that tell the reducer what the state should look like. The state is a collection of data used throughout the app. |
| [reducers](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/frontend/src/reducers) | Reducers specify how the state changes in response to dispatched actions. |
| [util](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/frontend/src/util) | Defines functions that make API calls to the backend - login, logout, signup, CRUD actions for trips. |
| [controllers](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/controllers) |The API controllers define what happens given a requested route. |
| [models](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/models) | Defines the schema for users, trips, and points of interest |
| [routes](https://github.com/alfredosumosav/routeplan/tree/master/routes/api) | Declares URIs for the backend. These are the endpoints hit by the util functions. |
